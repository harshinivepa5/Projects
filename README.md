# Projects
## Log Data Reconstruction
The objective of this project is to predict missing well log data, particularly the Gamma value, using machine learning techniques. Data is collected from sensors and transformed into accessible CSV format. Data preprocessing involves feature selection and cleaning to remove insignificant columns and empty cells. The dataset is split into training and test sets, with well "C6" as the test data. Model selection is performed using Dataiku Lab, and the Random Forest algorithm with an R2 score of 0.885 is chosen. Model evaluation on the test data shows accurate predictions with a negligible absolute error, indicating the model's ability to generalize. This model can be deployed for log data reconstruction.This Projects is performed in a node code platform called Dataiku.This Regression based solution optimizes costs and achieves efficiency through
implementation of ML Algorithms.
## Prediction of Facies Data
The project's objective is to predict facies values from well log data using machine learning algorithms, specifically for classification. Data collected from sensors and transformed into CSV format undergoes preprocessing, including feature selection, cleaning, and outlier removal. The dataset is then split into train and test sets, where well "C6" serves as the test data. Machine learning models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost, are evaluated. Random Forest with an R2 score of 0.868 is selected for model training. The model performs well with an accuracy of 73.38% on the test data, suggesting its deployability for classifying facies.A ML Model for prediction of facies values using available data ,effectively determining facies values with high accuracy in a no code Dataiku Platform.
